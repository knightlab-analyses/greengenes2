The distance matrices provided here were computed using QIIME 2's q2-diversity
plugin. See `../fig1def-s1cd-s2/process.py` for the specific commands used. A
rarefaction depth of 9,000 sequences per sample was used for the 16S data, and
a depth of 2,000,000 sequences per sample was used for the WGS data.

We cannot provide distance matrices for the FINRISK data as these are access
controlled.
